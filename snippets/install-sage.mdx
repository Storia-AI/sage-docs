## Install Sage
1. Make sure you're using a Python version between 3.8 and 3.11 (note that MacOS Sequoia 15 comes with Python 3.13, which is not currently supported).
    - To check your version, run `python3 --version`.
    - If your version is not supported, you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). For instance:
```
pyenv install 3.10.10
pyenv local 3.10.10
```

2. Make a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv my-venv
source my-venv/bin/activae
```

3. Install Sage:
```
pip install storia-sage
```
