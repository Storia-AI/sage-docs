## Setup API keys

By default, Sage uses Anthropic's Claude model as the underlying LLM. Grab an API key from your [account settings](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) and export it to an environment variable:
```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

If your GitHub repository is private, then you will also need a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). This is not necessary for public repositories.
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=...
```

## Chat with any codebase
You are now ready to chat with your codebase. Simply pass the repository name to the `sage-chat` command, in the `repo-org/repo-name` format. For instance, in order to chat with Hugging Face's [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library:
```
sage-chat huggingface/transformers
```
This will bring up a [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) UI that runs on localhost. Happy chatting!
