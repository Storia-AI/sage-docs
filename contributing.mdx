Thank you for considering contributing to Sage! To claim a task, take a look at our [unassigned issues](https://github.com/Storia-AI/sage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee) and comment directly on the ones you want to tackle. We strive to label issues with an approximate level of difficulty between 1 and 5.

We're excited to be part of Hacktoberfest 2024. Check out our curated list of [Hacktoberfest issues](https://github.com/Storia-AI/sage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest+no%3Aassignee). We add new ones daily!

## Setting up your environment
First, set up a Python virtual environment:
```
python -m venv sage-venv
source sage-venv/bin/activate
```

Next, clone the repository and install its dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/Storia-AI/sage.git
cd sage
pip install -e .
```

## Running unit tests
After you make your changes, double-check you haven't broken existing functionality by running unit tests:
```
pip install pytest
pytest sage/tests
```

## Code Formatting
To keep the codebase clean, we use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black). To run the formatters:
```
pip install isort black
isort sage
black --line-length=120 sage
```

## Types of contributions
While we welcome code contributions, there are many other ways to make an impact.
For instance, if you find this documentation incomplete or unclear, let us know via [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbtZe7GcVU), submit [an issue](https://github.com/Storia-AI/sage/issues/new/choose), or send a pull request with improved verbiage.
Any suggestions for simplifying the setup are also welcome.
